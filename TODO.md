| Hardware compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Extensive testing, prioritize common hardware | Focus on well-supported hardware initially |
| Raspberry Pi firmware changes | Low | Low | Track official firmware updates | Maintain compatibility with multiple firmware versions |
| Performance targets not met | High | Medium | Profile-guided optimization, assembly hotspots | Adjust targets based on realistic measurements |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Medium | Security audits, fuzzing, bounty program | Rapid patch releases, security-focused sprints |

### Resource Risks
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Development takes longer than 78 weeks | Medium | High | Prioritize MVP features, defer nice-to-haves | Extend timeline, phase releases (alpha, beta, stable) |
| Insufficient developer resources | High | Medium | Open source early, build community | Focus on core features, recruit contributors |
| Budget constraints (hardware testing) | Medium | Low | Use QEMU extensively, community hardware testing | Partner with Raspberry Pi Foundation for hardware |

## Notes

- This is an ambitious 78-week (19.5 month) plan for building a full operating system from scratch
- **Raspberry Pi is a first-class target**, not an afterthought
- Phases can overlap where dependencies allow
- Some phases may take longer or shorter depending on complexity and team size
- Regular checkpoints and adjustments are expected
- Focus on MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first, then iterate
- Performance and security are first-class concerns throughout
- Leverage existing open-source components where possible (but ensure licensing compatibility)
- The OS should feel familiar to users of modern OSes while offering unique advantages (speed, security, developer experience)

### Key Principles
1. **Memory Safety First**: Home's ownership system prevents entire classes of bugs
2. **Performance by Design**: Every feature should be benchmarked and optimized
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep the system small and auditable
4. **Documentation as Code**: Docs are as important as the code itself
5. **Test Everything**: If it's not tested, it's broken
6. **Community Driven**: Open source from day one, welcome contributions
7. **Educational Value**: Should be easy to understand and learn from
8. **Portability**: Write once, run on x86-64 and ARM64

### Decision Making Framework
When faced with a design choice, ask:
1. Does it improve security?
2. Does it improve performance?
3. Does it reduce complexity?
4. Is it testable?
5. Is it maintainable?
6. Does it align with the vision?

Choose the option that scores highest across these dimensions.

### Communication Channels (Post-Open Source)
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: Q&A, design discussions
- **Discord Server**: Real-time chat, community support
- **Mailing List**: Development updates, announcements
- **Blog**: Progress reports, technical deep-dives
- **Twitter/Mastodon**: Release announcements, highlights

### Funding Strategy
- **Open Source Foundation**: Apply for grants (Linux Foundation, etc.)
- **Sponsorships**: GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective
- **Corporate Partnerships**: Raspberry Pi Foundation, cloud providers
- **Hardware Vendors**: Collaborate with ARM, AMD, Intel
- **Educational Institutions**: Partner with universities
- **Consulting**: Offer paid support and custom development
