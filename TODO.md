- **Risk**: Hardware compatibility issues
  - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, prioritize common hardware first

### Resource Risks
- **Risk**: Development takes longer than 70 weeks

## Notes

- This is an ambitious 78-week (19.5 month) plan for building a full operating system from scratch
- **Raspberry Pi is a first-class target**, not an afterthought
- Phases can overlap where dependencies allow
- Some phases may take longer or shorter depending on complexity and team size
- Regular checkpoints and adjustments are expected
- Focus on MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first, then iterate
- Performance and security are first-class concerns throughout
- Leverage existing open-source components where possible (but ensure licensing compatibility)
- The OS should feel familiar to users of modern OSes while offering unique advantages (speed, security, developer experience)
