# CLAUDE - Critical Development Guidelines for home-os

## ðŸš¨ MOST IMPORTANT RULE ðŸš¨

**ALWAYS USE THE HOME PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR home-os DEVELOPMENT**

This is **HomeOS** - an operating system built with the Home programming language. We are NOT using Zig, Rust, C, or any other language except where absolutely unavoidable (like bootloader assembly).

### Language Policy

1. **Default to Home**: All new code MUST be written in Home (`.home` files)
2. **Home Compiler Location**: `~/Code/home/`
3. **Import Statement**: Use `const basics = @import("basics")` NOT `const std = @import("std")`
4. **File Extensions**: `.home` for Home language files

### When to Use Other Languages

Only use non-Home languages in these specific cases:
- **Assembly (`.s` files)**: ONLY for bootloader and low-level CPU initialization that absolutely cannot be done in Home
- **Zig/C/Other**: NEVER - if Home is missing a feature, extend Home first

### If Home is Missing Features

When Home doesn't have a feature we need:

1. **STOP** - Don't write Zig code as a workaround
2. **EXTEND HOME** - Add the feature to the Home compiler first
3. **DOCUMENT** - Update this file with what was added
4. **CONTINUE** - Then use the new Home feature in home-os

ðŸ“– **See:** `HOME_KERNEL_FEATURES.md` for complete feature audit

### Home Kernel Modules

Home provides these built-in kernel support modules:

- `kernel/multiboot2` - Multiboot2 bootloader support
- `ffi` - Foreign Function Interface
- `threading` - Threading primitives
- `driver` - Driver development support

### Project Structure

```
home-os/
â”œâ”€â”€ kernel/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ *.home          # All kernel code in Home
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.s             # Assembly only for boot/low-level
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ build.home          # Home build configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ linker.ld           # Linker script
â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md               # This file - READ THIS FIRST!
â””â”€â”€ TODO.md                 # 78-week development roadmap
```

### Development Workflow

1. Check if feature exists in Home compiler (`~/Code/home/`)
2. If missing, add it to Home first
3. Write home-os code using Home language
4. Build with Home compiler
5. Test in QEMU
6. Iterate

### Build System

- **Build Tool**: Home's native build system
- **Build File**: `kernel/build.home`
- **Build Command**: `home build` (once Home compiler supports it)
- **Temporary**: Using `zig` to compile until Home self-hosts

### Examples of Home Syntax

Based on the actual Home compiler source at `~/Code/home/`:

```home
// Hello World
fn main() {
  print("Hello, Home!")
}

// Functions with parameters and return types
fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int {
  return a + b
}

fn greet(name: string) {
  print("Hello")
  print(name)
}

// Variables
let result = add(10, 32)
let msg = "hello"

// Loops
loop {
  // infinite loop
}

// Conditionals
if condition {
  // do something
}

// Import statements (Zig-style for now since Home is Zig-based)
import basics/os/serial  // Home-style path
const serial = @import("os/serial.zig")  // Current Zig implementation

// Export functions (for kernel entry points)
export fn kernel_main(magic: u32, info: u32) -> never {
  // never return type for functions that don't return
  loop {
    cpu.hlt()
  }
}
```

**Key Differences from Zig:**
- `let` for variable declarations (not `const` or `var`)
- `loop` for infinite loops (not `while (true)`)
- `->` for return types (not `:`)
- No semicolons needed in many cases
- `import` statements use `/` path separators
- `never` type for non-returning functions

### Current Development Status

As of October 28, 2025:

- **Phase**: Building kernel in Home, extending Home compiler as needed
- **Approach**: Write `.home` code for OS, add missing features to Home compiler itself
- **Current Architecture**:
  - `kernel/src/*.home` - All kernel code written in Home
  - `kernel/src/*.s` - Assembly only for boot/initialization
  - `~/Code/home/` - Home compiler (extend this when features are needed)
  - `~/Code/home/packages/basics/src/os/` - Home's OS basics modules
  - `~/Code/home/packages/kernel/src/` - Home's comprehensive kernel package

- **Current Task**: Write all OS code in `.home` files, extend Home compiler as needed
- **Philosophy**: If Home doesn't have it, add it to Home - never work around with other languages
- **Next Steps**:
  1. âœ… Understand Home's actual architecture (DONE)
  2. âœ… Remove unnecessary bridge files (DONE)
  3. âœ… Update documentation with correct syntax (DONE)
  4. ðŸ”„ Write kernel code in `.home` files
  5. ðŸ”„ Extend Home compiler when features are needed but missing
  6. ðŸ”„ Leverage Home's kernel package modules as reference
  7. ðŸ”„ Continue with TODO.md Phase 1 tasks (IDT, memory management) in Home

### Remember

**THIS IS HomeOS - BUILDING WITH HOME**

**Philosophy**: This OS is built with the Home programming language. When Home needs a feature, we extend Home itself:

1. **Current State (Phase 1 - Foundation)**:
   - âœ… Always write `.home` files for all OS code
   - âœ… Reference Home's kernel package (`~/Code/home/packages/kernel/`) for architecture
   - âœ… Use Home language features that exist today
   - âœ… Extend Home compiler when features are missing

2. **Development Strategy**:
   - Write all OS code in `.home` files
   - If a feature needs nicer API/syntax that doesn't exist yet â†’ Add it to Home compiler first
   - If a feature cannot be implemented in current Home â†’ Extend Home compiler, then implement
   - Keep OS code clean, well-documented, and idiomatic Home

3. **When to Use Each Language**:
   - **Home**: ALL kernel code, drivers, system utilities, everything
   - **Assembly**: ONLY for bootloader and CPU initialization that cannot be done in Home
   - **Other languages**: NEVER (extend Home instead)

4. **Decision Framework**:
   - Need a feature? â†’ Check if Home has it
   - Home missing the feature? â†’ Add it to Home compiler (`~/Code/home/`)
   - Need better API/syntax? â†’ Design and implement in Home compiler first
   - Feature now exists? â†’ Use it in home-os
   - Absolutely unavoidable low-level boot code? â†’ Assembly only

**Bottom Line**: Write `.home` files for the OS. When Home lacks a feature, extend Home first, then use it. Never use other languages except Assembly for unavoidable boot code.
